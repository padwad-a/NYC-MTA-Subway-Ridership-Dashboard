# üöá NYC MTA Subway Ridership Dashboard

An interactive data visualization dashboard built using **Dash**, **Plotly**, and **Pandas** to explore ridership patterns in the NYC MTA subway system. This project leverages open data from the New York State government to provide insights into hourly ridership trends, station-level traffic, and geographical patterns.

To start this tool, run `app.py`.

## üìÅ About the Project

The goal of this project is to help users‚Äîcommuters, analysts, city planners‚Äîvisually understand:

- Hourly subway ridership patterns across time and boroughs
- Peak traffic periods
- Station-wise distribution using an interactive map
- Dynamic filtering based on date ranges

The project is modular, scalable, and designed with clean separation of concerns for better readability and maintainability.
